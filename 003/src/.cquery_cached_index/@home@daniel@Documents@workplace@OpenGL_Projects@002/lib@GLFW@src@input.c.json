This is useful for implementing for\n  example 3D camera controls.\n\nIf the mode is `GLFW_STICKY_KEYS`, the value must be either `GLFW_TRUE` to\nenable sticky keys, or `GLFW_FALSE` to disable it.  If sticky keys are\nenabled, a key press will ensure that @ref glfwGetKey returns `GLFW_PRESS`\nthe next time it is called even if the key had been released before the\ncall.

This is useful when\nyou are only interested in whether mouse buttons have been pressed but not\nwhen or in which order.\n\nIf the mode is `GLFW_LOCK_KEY_MODS`, the value must be either `GLFW_TRUE` to\nenable lock key modifier bits, or `GLFW_FALSE` to disable them.  If enabled,\ncallbacks that receive modifier bits will also have the @ref\nGLFW_MOD_CAPS_LOCK bit set when the event was generated with Caps Lock on,\nand the @ref GLFW_MOD_NUM_LOCK bit when Num Lock was on.\n\nIf the mode is `GLFW_RAW_MOUSE_MOTION`, the value must be either `GLFW_TRUE`\nto enable raw (unscaled and unaccelerated) mouse motion when the cursor is\ndisabled, or `GLFW_FALSE` to disable it.  If raw motion is not supported,\nattempting to set this will emit @ref GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.
